    "text": "Talking head video generation aims to produce a synthetic human face video that contains the identity and pose information respectively from a given source image and a driving video. Existing works for this task heavily rely on 2D representations (e.g. appearance and motion) learned from the input images. However, dense 3D facial geometry (e.g. pixel-wise depth) is extremely important for this task as it is particularly beneficial for us to essentially generate accurate 3D face structures and distinguish noisy information from the possibly cluttered background. Nevertheless, dense 3D geometry annotations are prohibitively costly for videos and are typically not available for this video generation task. In this paper, we first introduce a self-supervised geometry learning method to automatically recover the dense 3D geometry (i.e. depth) from the face videos without the requirement of any expensive 3D annotation data. Based on the learned dense depth maps, we further propose to leverage them to estimate sparse facial keypoints that capture the critical movement of the human head. In a more dense way, the depth is also utilized to learn 3D-aware cross-modal (i.e. appearance and depth) attention to guide the generation of motion fields for warping source image representations. All these contributions compose a novel depth-aware generative adversarial network (DaGAN) for talking head generation. Extensive experiments conducted demonstrate that our proposed method can generate highly realistic faces, and achieve significant results on the unseen human faces. 1",

A successful direction for the task in the literature focuses on decoupling identity and pose information from the face images [24, 27, 33]. For instance, pioneering works [24, 27] propose to model relative poses between two face images based on estimated sparse facial keypoints, and the poses are further used to generate dense motion fields, which warps the feature maps of the source image to drive the image generation. Similarly, Eurkov et al . [1] aimed to specifically learn two latent codes for the pose and the identity, and then input them into a designed generator network for face video synthesis. More than that, data augmentation strategies [1,40] are also explored to more effectively perform the disentanglement of the pose and identity information. Although these methods show highly promising performance on the task, they still pay large attention to learning more representative 2D appearance and motion features from the input images. However, for face video generation, 3D dense geometry is critically important for the task while rarely in-\nvestigated in the existing methods.",

    "text": "The dense 3D geometry ( e.g . pixel-level depth) can bring several significant benefits for the talking-head video generation. First, as the video captures the moving heads in a realistic 3D physical world, the 3D geometry can greatly facilitate an accurate recovery of 3D face structures, and the model capability of maintaining a realistic 3D face structure is a key factor for generating high-fidelity face videos. Second, the dense geometry can also help the model to robustly distinguish the noisy background information for generation especially under cluttered background conditions. Finally, the dense geometry is also particularly useful for the model to identify expression-related micro-movements on the faces. However, a severe issue of utilizing the 3D dense geometry to significantly boost the generation is that the 3D geometry annotations are highly expensive and typically not available for this task.\nTo address this problem, in this paper, we first propose to learn the pixel-wise depth map (see Fig. 1b) via geometric warping and photometric consistency in a self-supervised manner, to automatically recover dense 3D facial geometry from the training face videos, without requiring any expensive 3D geometry annotations. Based on the learned dense facial depth maps, we further propose two mechanisms to effectively leverage the depth information for better talkinghead video generation. The first mechanism is depth-guided facial keypoint detection. The facial keypoints estimated by the network should well reflect the structure of the face, as they are further used to produce the motion field for feature warping, while the depth map explicitly indicates the 3D structure of the face. Thus, we combine geometry representations learned from the input depth maps with the appearance representations learned from the input images, to predict more accurate facial keypoints. The second mechanism is a cross-modal attention mechanism to guide the learning of the motion field. The motion field may contain noisy information from the cluttered background, and cannot effectively capture the expression-related micro-movements as they are generated from sparse facial keypoints. Therefore, we propose to learn depth-aware attention to have pixel-wise 3D geometry constraint on the motion field (see Fig. 1c), to drive the generation with more fine-grained details of facial structure and movements.",

    "text": "Generative Adversarial Networks. The generative adversarial network (GAN) was introduced by Goodfellow et al . [5] to produce realistic images under certain conditions. GANs have attracted substantial attention and has been studied in many tasks [17], such as image synthesis [5, 13, 14, 21], text-to-image translation [22,36], and image inpainting [11,15,16]. In this work, we focus on talking head video generation with GAN guided by 3D facial depth maps learned without any ground-truth depths.\nDepth Estimation. Many works have been proposed to tackle the problem of depth estimation from stereo images or video sequences [3, 4, 7, 18, 41]. Zhou et al . [41] use an end-to-end learning approach with view synthesis as the supervisory signal to estimate the depth map in monocular video sequences in an unsupervised manner. Based on [41], Clement et al . [4] gain a significant improvement using a minimum reprojection loss to deal with occlusions between frames and an auto-masking loss to ignore confusing stationary pixels. Gordon et al . [6] tried to learn camera intrinsics for every two consecutive frames to make the model able to perform inference in the wild.\nHowever, our work aims to learn facial depth maps in an unsupervised manner for the talking head generation task with only video images required. The depth map can provide dense 3D geometric information for the keypoint detection and can serve as an important cue to guide the model to focus on fine-grained critical parts of the human face ( e.g . eyes, and mouth) during image generation.\nTalking Head Video Generation. Talking head video generation can be divided into three major strategies according to its driven-modality, i.e . image-driving methods [1, 24, 27, 29, 33, 37], landmark-driving methods [8, 34, 35, 38] and audio-driving methods [2, 25, 39, 40].

We learn dense depth-aware attention map using depth maps to constrain the motion field, to obtain a more accurate generation of fine-grained details of facial structure and movements.\ndriving face's identity information, several image-driving methods [24, 27] tried to predict keypoints of both the source image and driving image, and model local motion using changes in the positions of corresponding keypoints. Using facial landmarks instead of pure images to encode the pose information is an intuitive method. The fsvid2vid [35] models person appearance by decomposing it into two layers, i.e . a pose-dependent coarse image and a pose-independent texture image. Zhao et al . [38] not only model global motions using full facial landmarks, but also use local landmarks to enforce the model to focus on local regions. The audio-driving method is a more popular way to perform face reenactment since the audio does not contain identity information, which can enable the model to more easily obtain a latent code of pose information from the audio. In [39], the encoder disentangles the pose information from identity information assisted by the audio modality.\nIn contrast to these existing works, we learn explicit pixel-wise depth map in a self-supervised manner, to provide highly beneficial 3D dense geometry information of the human faces, which allows the proposed model to accurately perceive 3D structures of the faces, and generate more fine-grained details of face spatial structures.",

Although SfMLearner [41] previously proposed to learn outdoor scene depth in an unsupervised manner in an autonomous driving scenario, while in this work, we extend the method to learn face depths specifically for talking head video generation. Since the facial videos contain relatively larger-area dynamic motion (moving head dominating on the image) compared to the outdoor scenes, unsupervised facial depth estimation is a challenging problem in our task.\nWe optimize the depth network using available training face videos. Specifically, given two consecutive video frames I i and I i +1 from a face video, with I i +1 as a source image and I i as a target image, we aim to learn several geometric elements, including a depth map D I i for the target image I i , a camera intrinsic matrix K I i → I i +1 , and a relative camera pose R I i → I i +1 with translation t I i → I i +1 between the two images. It should be noted that the camera intrinsic K I i → I i +1 is also not available in our training face video dataset, which is clearly different from [41] directly using provided camera intrinsic parameters for geometric warping. K I i → I i +1 is input-video-clip specifically learned in our method, as each face video can be possibly captured by any camera. So the input of our method only requires video frames.\nThe depth map D I i can be produced using the depth network F d ( · ) . The pose R I i → I i +1 , the translation t I i → I i +1 , and the camera intrinsic matrix K I i → I i +1 are predicted from the same pose network F p ( · ) as follows:\nD I i = F d ( I i ) , (1)\n[ R I i → I i +1 , t I i → I i +1 ] , K I i → I i +1 = F p ( I i || I i +1 ) , (2)\nwhere the symbol || indicates a concatenation of the two images.

Our method obtains the best scores in these three metrics, clearly confirming our initial motivation that introducing the 3D depth maps can greatly benefit the keypoint-based generation.\nCross-identity reenactment. Wealso perform experiments on the CelebV dataset to exploit the cross-identity motion transfer, where the source and driving images are from different persons. We report the experimental results in Table 3. As we can observe that the PRMSE and AUCON of our DaGAN method remain the best among all methods, achieving 2.33 for PRMSE and 0.873 for AUCON. We also present several generated examples in Fig 6 and 7. As some methods do not release their code, we only show the results of those methods with available codes ( e.g . FOMM and OSFV). For the seen faces in Fig. 6, our method produces face images with more fine-grained details than the others. For instance, the mouth and eyes regions in three rows. It verifies that the utilization of depth maps enables the model to identify micro-expression movements of the human faces. For the unseen targets in the CelebV dataset, we also show some generated samples in Fig. 7. Our method can also produce visually natural results for unseen targets. Notably, the generated images of OSFV in the first row is almost the same as the source image as it cannot detect the subtle motion on the face, which is also part of the reason why it outperforms our method in terms of CSIM in Tab. 3.\nTable 4.

    "text": "In this section, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised face depth learning method and the proposed two mechanisms for talking head generation. We report results of ablation studies in Tab. 4, and show several qualitative examples of the generation results in Fig. 8 and Fig. 10. Here, our baseline is the simplest model trained without the depth map and depth attention module.\nDense face geometry recovery. We first show recovered depth maps for human faces from the proposed face depth network. Since we do not have any ground-truth depths for the face images, it is tricky to directly evaluate the depth estimation quantitatively. Thus, we visualize the learned face depth maps and their corresponding 3d point clouds in Fig. 9. These visualization results strongly demonstrate that our proposed depth learning network is able to effectively recover the dense 3D geometry of human faces. The learned dense 3D facial structures are clearly very beneficial, and directly embedded in the proposed model to learn both sparse facial keypoints and global pixel-wise dense attention for the warping of features for generation, leading to a significant improvement on the generation.\nEffectiveness of depth-guided keypionts. We aim to explore the impact of depth map on keypoints detection and report the related results in Tab. 4. From Tab. 4, we can easily recognize that the depth-guided keypoints helps our model gain significant gain in PRMSE and AUCON, which indicate that the depth map really plays a significant role in the talking head generation task. From Fig. 8, the 'Baseline w/ FDN' predicts more accurate head orientation than 'Baseline', which can also be observed in Tab. 4, i.e . 2.69 vs. 5.39, on the PRMSE metric. This indicates that the proposed depth-guided facial-keypoints estimator models more accurate motions of the human heads.\nSource image\nDriving image\nBaseline\nBaseline w/ FDN\nBaseline w/ CAM\nOurs\nDepth map 𝐃 \"\nFigure 8.

In the last three columns, the red mark ' × ' indicates the query location.\nEffectiveness of cross-modal attention module. From the Tab. 4 and Fig. 8, the cross-modal attention module (CAM) can clearly improve the generation quality of expressionrelated micro-movements of human faces. In Fig. 8, we can observe that the generated face results with the proposed CAM module ( i.e . 'Baseline w/ CAM') have more vivid expression ( e.g . at eye regions) than that of 'Baseline w/ FDN' and 'Baseline'. It verifies that the proposed CAM enables the model to capture the expression-related micro-movements at important facial regions ( e.g ., eyes and mouth). Additionally, the variance 'Baseline w/ CAM'\noutperform 'Baseline' by 0.181 in AUCON. The results in Tab. 4 and Fig. 8 verify that our proposed depth attention module can effectively utilize the depth map to enable model focus on micro-movement of the human face to boost the quality of the generated image.\nAdditionally, we visualize the dense depth-aware attention maps in Fig. 10. The high activation areas of each query point are mainly located in the expression-related parts of the human face, ( e.g . eyes, nose, and mouth). These visualization results indicate that our designed cross-modal ( i.e . depth and RGB) attention module can indeed address the micro-movements of the human face to produce more vivid expression in generation.\nPlug-and-play experiments. Additionally, we also plug our proposed face depth network and depth-aware crossmodal attention module into FOMM [24], i.e ., using FOMM as a strong baseline, as our proposed modules can be flexibly deployed into existing video generation methods. The results are reported in Tab. 4. It is obvious that FOMM with the proposed modules can further achieve a significant improvement. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of learning dense 3D facial geometry ( i.e . depth) for the talking head video generation task.",

    "text": "Perceptual loss L P . To ensure that the generated images are similar to their corresponding ground truths, we use a multiscale implementation introduced by FOMM [24]. Specifically, we first downsample the ground truth and the output image to 4 different resolutions ( i.e . 256 × 256 , 128 × 128 , 64 × 64 and 32 × 32 ). We denote R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 as the generated images, and G 1 , G 2 , G 3 , G 4 as the corresponding ground truths of the four different resolutions, respectively. Then a pre-trained VGG network is used to extract features from both these downsampled ground truths and the output images. We compute the L 1 distance between the ground truth and output image in different resolutions:\nL P = 4 ∑ i =1 L 1 ( G i , R i ) (11)\nGAN loss L G . Given the ground truths and the generated images in 256 × 256 resolution, we adopt an adversarial learning objective function consisting of a least square loss and a feature matching loss introduced in the pix2pixHD [26] to train our DaGAN. Single-scale discriminators are used for training 256 × 256 images.\nEquivariance loss L E . This loss is utilized to ensure the consistency of the estimated keypoints, which is also adopted by FOMM [24]. Given an image I and one of its detected keypoint x k , we perform a known spatial transformation T on image I , resulting in a transformed image I T . Therefore, the detected keypoints x T ( k ) on this transformed image I T should be transformed in the same way. Thus, for the K detected keypoints from image I , we have:\nL E = K ∑ i =1 || x k -T -1 ( x T ( k ) ) || 1 (12)\nKeypoints distance loss L D . To make the detected facial keypoints much less crowded around a small neighbourhood, we employ a keypoints distance loss to penalize the model if the distance between two corresponding keypoints falls below a pre-defined threshold. For every two keypoints x i and x j in an image, we thus have:\nglyph[negationslash]",

Our face depth network consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is a ResNet18 network [9] without the final fully connected and pooling layers. The structure of the decoder is illustrated in Fig. 11a, which predicts a depth map with a size of 1 × 256 × 256 .\nKeypoint estimator F kp . In the training process, we concatenate the RGB image and its corresponding depth map to form an RGB-D input with a size of 4 × 256 × 256 , while the ouputs are K keypoints { x τ,n } K n =1 , x τ,n ∈ R 1 × 2 . The detailed structure of the keypoint estimator is shown in Fig. 11b.\nOcclusion estimator T . We utilize the occlusion estimator to predict an occlusion map to filter out the regions that should be inpainted, and a motion flow mask for weighting the motion field. As illustrated in Fig. 11c, there are two heads at the end to predict these two parts.\nFeature encoder E I . In Fig. 11f, to preserve low-level texture of the image, we only apply two DownBlocks to construct the feature encoder E I in the feature warping module.\nDepth encoder E d . The architecture of our depth encoder E d in the cross-modal attention module is shown in Fig. 11g. The structure is the same as E I , and thus we can make the features learned from both modalities with the same level of representation power.\nFigure 11. Architecture details of each components in our model. The 'DownBlock2d' (Fig. 11d) contains a convolutional layer with 3 × 3 kernel, a batch normalization layer, a ReLU activation layer, and an average pooling layer that downsamples the input. The interpolation layer in 'UpBlock2d' (Fig. 11d) is utilized to upsample the image. The symbol '/2' in other sub-networks indicates an average pooling layer to downsample the input.",

Each learned 3D spatial depth point is inherently used as a query for calculating a global self-attention, which is thus depth-aware. Here, we disable the depth in the cross-modal attention module, which then becomes a standard self-attention module, termed as Ours (SA). A qualitative comparison in Fig. 12 shows the difference of using and not using depth for the attention learning. Our cross-modal attention can effectively learn to attend to key foreground facial regions (e.g. expression-related keypoint regions), comparing to the one without depth ( i.e . Ours (SA)) which also attends to cluttered backgrounds, further confirming the advantage of dense 3D geometry for overcoming noisy background in generation.\nMore qualitative results. We show more samples in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14. The visualization shows that our DaGAN can produce more natural-looking faces than the other comparison methods. More than that, we also present our generated depth maps of the source images and the driving images. We can observe that our estimated depth maps can effectively distinguish the face foreground area of an image from the background. These robustly predicted depth maps can also verify the effectiveness of our method for self-supervised dense geometry recovery.\nVideo generation demo. Wealso provide a video generation demonstration to show a more detailed comparison qualitatively with the most competitive methods in the literature, including FOMM [24] and OSFV [27].

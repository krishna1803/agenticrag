Accordingly, the question essential to whether a putative \"improvement\" on land is an \"improvement\" as defined, being whether the putati ve \"improvement\" _increases_ the value of the land and the benefit of that putative \"impro vement\" _is_ unexhausted, is to be determined by a comparison of the market value of the l and with and without the putative \"improvement\".

The issue in this Court arises from a claim, made by two passengers who travelled on an Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Sydney in July 2019, for damages arising from spina l and psychological injury allegedly caused by turbulence experienced on the flight. In th e Supreme Court of New South Wales, the passengers sought damages from Air Canada for thes e bodily injuries under Art 17 of the Montreal Convention, as incorporated into Australian law.**[2]** Air Canada relied upon a partial defence in Art 21(2) of the Montreal Convent ion, available where the damage was not due to negligence or any other wrongful act or omi ssion by Air Canada or its servants or agents. Under that partial defence, damages would b e subject to a cap that limited the extent of the passengers' recovery to 113,100**[3]** S pecial Drawing Rights (an international reserve asset created by the International Monetar y Fund**[4]**) which is approximately $240,000 at present exchange rates. The appellant pa ssengers replied that, under Art 25, Air Canada had waived the partial defence in Art 21(2 ) because the Air Canada Tariff provided in r",

As already explained, the travaux préparatoires to the Montr eal Convention are replete with references to liability for personal injury or death withi n the terms of Art 17 being \"unlimited\". Indeed, the limit to the equivalent liability for personal injury or death in the Warsaw Convention was the reason that that Convention had been so controversial. The effect of Arts 17 and 21 of the Montreal Convention is to esta blish two tiers of liability so that the \"no negligence\" defence in Art 21(2) will only ap ply in the second tier; neither Art 17 nor Art 21 imposes any financial limits in respect of the overall Art 17 liability of carriers for death or bodily injury. The limit or thres hold is only for the application of the defence in Art 21(2). Rule 105(C)(1)(a) therefore correctly declares that \"[t]here are no financial limits in respect of death or bodily inj ury\". The concern of r",

Secondly, r 105(C)(1), like the other provisions of r 105(B) and (C), gives effect to the Canadian _Air Transportation Regulations_ , including the requirement to state the li mits of and exclusions from liability respecting passengers and goods. Those Regulations r equired the Air Canada Tariff to describe the legal effect of multiple instruments since, as Leeming JA observed in the Court of Appeal, passengers on an Air Canada flight could be subject to different legal regimes depending upon the points of connection of the flight. **[83]** The relevant regimes to which the relevant parts of the Air Canada Tariff are dir ected include the Warsaw Convention, the 1995/6 IATA Agreements, the Canadian _Air Transpo rtation Regulations_ , and the Montreal Convention.",

For instance, as Leeming JA observed in the Court of Appeal, referen ce to \"in most cases\" in r 105(C)(1)(b) and (c) is \"the language of a provision which is i ntended concisely to notify passengers of the limits to which their contract of carriage b y air is subject\".**[84]** The reference to \"in most cases\" reflects the possibility of ex ceptional circumstances such as a \"special declaration\" under Art 22(2) in cases where, fo r example, a passenger has extremely valuable baggage and is prepared to pay more for a hi gher limit of liability.

Of course, there would be n o inconsistency that would arise by Air Canada exercising the power recognised in Art 25 f or Air Canada to raise or waive the limit or the threshold applicable to the Art 21(2) def ence, or by exercising the power in Art 27 to waive any defence. But, unlike r 105(B)(1), which, in accordance with the terms of the 1995/6 IATA Agreements, waives defences under t he Warsaw Convention, r 105(C)(1)(a) does not use the language of waiver. Nor does it use the language of raising or abolishing the limit for the application of the defence in Art 21(2).",

Those offices included \"members of the Divisional Executive, Divisional Conference, D ivisional Trustees, Divisional Branch Committee of Management, Divisional Branch Council a nd Divisional Branch Trustees\". In purely formal terms, those former officers, and the mem bers they represented, remain free to engage in political activity either individually or in association with each other. But the practical reality of the removal of 292 offices is the removal of the incumbents' political platform, the blunting of their political connec tions, and the stifling of their ability to exploit their political know-how and expertise born from lobbying and campaigning. Thus, as Mr Hiscox submitted, the power to remove off iceholders from their offices stifles the ability of those officeholders to participate in political matters that affect the interests of members. Individually, such former officeh olders retain their liberty to speak. But the megaphone of their office is removed. So too , for the reasons below, do the Legislative Amendments",

The plaintiffs did not suggest that any equitable rights of the members of the C&G Division were acquired. The assets held on trust for those members by the CFME U are controlled and managed by the Administrator, who must, at least, be satisfied that h is actions are taken in the best interests of the C&G Division members. The property which the plaintiffs assert has been acquired under s 323K must therefore be the trust power of the CFMEU in relation to the assets that it holds on trust for the members of the C&G Div ision. The effect of s 323K(1), as explained above,**[390]** is to vest that trust power i n the Administrator. But there may be difficulties in seeing the Administrator's duty to e xercise a trust power as \"property\".**[391]** The plaintiffs also face obstacles in their submissions that s 323M effects an \"acquisition\" of property by remunerating the Administr ator from CFMEU funds for work done for the benefit of",
